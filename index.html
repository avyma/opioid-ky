                <h3>Overview & Acknowledgement</h3>
                   <p>
                   What began was a mere curiosity and an opportunity to quickly get the last 10 points transformed suddenly to an earnest geospatial analysis endeavor. It is only now that after over 8 years living here in Lexington, have I began to actually see the faces of the people struggling against addiction and recovery. Struck by the magnitude of the tragedy, it is a personal regret that there is no longer personal time and resources for a more in-depth analysis so that better stories can be told, new awareness and deeper understanding can be reached. Furthermore, it is difficult to accept that this project should be viewed
                   as a first-attempt, entry point to a more comprehensive analysis, as pleaded by Ryan Cooper, one the co-instructor in the course. But at the very least, this project has provided this one person of a deeper understanding of the community he is a part of.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       I would like to take this moment to thank Ryan Cooper for his assistance throughout. On Slack, I am amazed that I can get an answer to a question in the course or anything related to coding and GIS at any time - late at night, during the day, or early in the morning. That is rare and true commitment. I would like to thank Boyd Shearer, who have helped straightened out my registration with CARTO. I would like to thank the members of my class especially those who have provided help and answers for my far-out questions on Slack.
                   </p> 

                   <p> 
                       I would like to take this opportunity to thank Matt Wilson who have convinced me to take this course, as well as Jeff Levy and his staff who ensured that I was abled to register for this course. A special thank also goes to Stephen Davis, a dear friend who have suggested that I could contact Matt Wilson - with his convincing and my eventuality of enrolling in this course.
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                        Last and by far not least, I would like to thank my wife, Ann who has the immense virtue of patience. Ann often has to endure from early to late questions like "Can we map that?", "How about mapping it like this?", "Find me someone who knows about this?". Without Ann, the passion and motivation would not be present.

                   </p>

                   <p>
                       Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
                   </p>
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                   <p>  
                    Initially, the idea for the project was conceived from headline news about the extent of the drug crisis in the US that happened to coincide with the Lab 10 - final assignment for MAP671. Eventually, through personal interests and research, this has prompted
                    initiatives to interview medical professionals, community leaders to understand the background and then how best to design and structure this project. Although Kentucky is regarded as the epicenter of the crisis, the availability of public data seemed lacking especially when compared
                    to other states. Most unfortunate and astounding is the fact that data were suppressed for those counties with opioid related deaths of less than 5 per year.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    Although generally known nationally as the "opioid crisis", deaths relating to other dangerous drugs are just as significant if not more impactful especially considering the characteristic of drug-used and choices of drugs seemed to correlate to geographical area in the country, income and age groups. Regrettably, because
                    of the scope of the project, mortality relating to other deadly drugs that makes up the drug crisis were not analyzed and mapped. The difficulty behind recording and collecting data on drug-related deaths as the result of multiple drugs bring into question the reliability of the data to truly reflect the actual impact of the crisis. Other drugs outside of this project, as noted by the Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center are as follows: 1) Heroin; 2) Fentanyl; and 3) Psychostimulants (with abuse potential).
                    Lastly, to tackle the drug epidemic, expert has noted the importance of working with community leaders and health professionals at the local level. Availability of data on the impact and resource availability is critical for mobilization of external resources. Within a few days of working on this project, it is realized that in order to understand the impact and the response efforts, data at the county level is not enough. Data needs to be at least at the census tract level. This could be useful in designing cross-analysis with
                    demographic census data in order to garner a clearer view on the income, education, employment efforts of the locality. To be sure, availability of data at the census level is not readily available to the public especially in Kentucky. 
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    In sum, the experience in doing this project is a true eye-opener to the importance of understanding the tragedies of the locality that one lives in. The analysis and mapping exercise presented in this Lab 10 in no way do justice in providing a clear, accurate and complete view of the opioid tragedy here in Kentucky. Much more needed to be done. Deeper stories needed to be told. Better maps need to be imagined, designed and constructed.
